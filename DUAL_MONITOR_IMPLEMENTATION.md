2. **PPI Window** (`CPPIWindow`)
   - Plan Position Indicator display with map canvas
   - Integrated track table
   - Settings toolbar with map controls
   - Right-click context menu for tracks

3. **Controls Window** (`CControlsWindow`)
   - Rich tabbed interface with all control panels
   - Configuration, Interfaces, Simulation, Recording, etc.
   - Modern tab-based navigation
   - Comprehensive system management

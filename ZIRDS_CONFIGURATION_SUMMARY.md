## Changes Implemented

### 1. Application Branding
‚úÖ **Application Name Updated**

- PPI window stays on top as welcome screen
- Delay timers ensure proper window stacking

### 4. Logo Integration

‚úÖ **Splash Screen with Branding**
- Custom splash screen with Zoppler logo support
- Displays "ZIRDS" and full system name
- Copyright notice: "¬© Zoppler Systems"
- Fallback text-based splash if logo not found

# Drone Object Implementation

## Overview

This implementation treats tracks as drones with internal state, dynamics, and detailed information displayed in the PPI track visualization.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. **Drone Class (`cdrone.h` / `cdrone.cpp`)**

A comprehensive drone object class has been created with the following features:

#### Internal State Management
- **Power & Battery**
  - Battery level (0-100%)
  - Battery voltage
  - Power consumption
  - Estimated flight time remaining

- **Flight Dynamics**
  - Pitch, roll, yaw angles
  - Vertical speed
  - Ground speed
  - Acceleration
  - Bearing change rate

- **Mission Information**
  - Flight modes: IDLE, TAKEOFF, CRUISE, LOITER, RTB, LANDING, EMERGENCY
  - Mission ID
  - Waypoint tracking (current/total)
  - Mission progress percentage

- **Sensor Status**
  - GPS (active/inactive, quality)
  - IMU (active/inactive)
  - Camera, Radar, LIDAR status
  - Communication link quality

- **Environmental Data**
  - Temperature
  - Wind speed and direction

- **System Health**
  - Overall health status
  - Status messages
  - Automatic health checks

#### Dynamics Calculation
The drone automatically calculates real-time dynamics based on position updates:
- **Bearing Change Rate**: Degrees per second (indicates turning)
- **Acceleration**: Change in velocity over time
- **Climb Rate**: Vertical speed calculation
- **Attitude**: Pitch/roll based on maneuvers

#### Battery Management
Realistic battery consumption model:
- Base drain during cruise
- Increased consumption based on:
  - Speed
  - Vertical movement
  - Maneuvers (acceleration, turning)
- Automatic voltage calculation
- Flight time estimation

#### Health Monitoring
Automatic system health checks:
- Battery level warnings (RTB at <15%)
- GPS quality monitoring
- Communication link strength
- Emergency mode triggers

### 2. **Data Structure Updates (`globalstructs.h`)**

Enhanced `stTrackDisplayInfo` structure:
```cpp
struct stTrackDisplayInfo {
    // ... existing track fields ...
    CDrone* pDrone;  // Pointer to associated drone object
};
```

### 3. **Data Warehouse Integration (`cdatawarehouse.h/cpp`)**

The data warehouse now manages drone objects:

#### New Functions
- `CDrone* getDrone(int trackId)`: Get drone for a track
- `void createDroneForTrack(int trackId)`: Create new drone
- `void updateDroneForTrack(int trackId)`: Update drone dynamics

#### Automatic Management
- Drones are automatically created when tracks are received
- Drone dynamics are updated with each track update
- Drones are properly cleaned up when tracks are deleted

### 4. **PPI Visualization (`ctracklayer.h/cpp`)**

#### New Visualization Function: `drawDroneInternalDetails()`

When a track is focused (right-click → Focus Track), detailed drone information is displayed in a comprehensive panel:

**Panel Features:**
- **Color-coded health indicator**: Green (healthy), Yellow (warning), Red (critical)
- **Semi-transparent glass effect**: Modern UI design
- **Connection line**: Visual link from panel to drone
- **Battery level visual bar**: Quick status at a glance

**Information Displayed:**
```

- Color-coded sections (cyan headers, white data)
- Status-based coloring (red for emergency, yellow for warnings)
- Battery indicator bar at bottom
- Health status bar on left side
- Rounded corners and drop shadow for modern look

### 5. **User Interaction**

To view detailed drone information:
1. **Right-click on any track** in the PPI display
2. Select **"🎯 Focus Track"** from the context menu
3. The detailed drone information panel will appear next to the track
4. The panel **follows the drone** as it moves
5. Right-click and select "🎯 Focus Track" again to unfocus

## Flight Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| IDLE | Drone on ground, systems ready |
| TAKEOFF | Ascending to cruise altitude |
| CRUISE | Normal flight operation |
| LOITER | Holding position, circling |
| RETURN_TO_BASE (RTB) | Returning home (auto-triggered at 15% battery) |
| LANDING | Descending for landing |
| EMERGENCY | Critical system failure |

## Health Status Colors

| Color | Meaning | Conditions |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 🟢 Green | Healthy | All systems operational, battery >25% |
| 🟡 Yellow | Warning | Battery 15-25%, degraded sensors |
| 🔴 Red | Critical | Battery <15%, emergency mode, weak link |

## Code Organization

### New Files Created
- `cdrone.h` - Drone class header
- `cdrone.cpp` - Drone class implementation

### Modified Files
- `globalstructs.h` - Added drone pointer to track structure
- `cdatawarehouse.h/cpp` - Drone management functions
- `MapDisplay/ctracklayer.h/cpp` - Drone visualization
- `RadarDisplay.pro` - Added drone files to build

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions to the drone system:
1. **Real-time telemetry streaming** via UDP
2. **Drone image/icon display** instead of generic track symbol
3. **Mission waypoint visualization** on map
4. **Historical telemetry graphs** (battery, altitude, speed over time)
5. **Multi-drone formation tracking**
6. **Collision avoidance zones**
7. **Geofence boundary display**
8. **Video feed integration**
9. **Payload status monitoring**
10. **Communication logs**

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Get drone for a track
CDrone* pDrone = CDataWarehouse::getInstance()->getDrone(trackId);

if (pDrone) {
    // Get current internal state
    stDroneInternalState state = pDrone->getInternalState();
    
    // Check battery level
    if (state.batteryLevel < 20.0f) {
        qWarning() << "Low battery on drone" << trackId;
    }
    
    // Get flight mode
    QString mode = pDrone->getFlightModeString();
    
    // Get health status color
    QColor healthColor = pDrone->getHealthStatusColor();
    
    // Get dynamics
    double bearingChangeRate = pDrone->getBearingChangeRate();
}
```

## Building the Project

```bash
cd /workspace
qmake RadarDisplay.pro
make
```

## Notes

- All tracks are automatically treated as drones
- Drone objects are created on-demand when tracks appear
- Battery consumption is simulated realistically based on flight dynamics
- Health checks run automatically on every state update
- The drone panel only appears when a track is focused
- Multiple tracks can be focused, but only one panel shows at a time

## Testing

To test the drone system:
1. Run the application
2. Tracks will appear as drones automatically
3. Right-click any track and select "Focus Track"
4. Observe the detailed drone information panel
5. Watch the battery level decrease over time
6. Observe dynamics changes as the drone moves

## Performance Considerations

- Drone objects use minimal memory (~500 bytes per drone)
- Dynamics calculations are efficient (O(1) complexity)
- Panel rendering is optimized with QPainter
- Only focused drones show detailed panels (reduces rendering overhead)
- Battery updates use delta-time for frame-rate independence
